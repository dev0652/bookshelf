A two-page website that allows you to browse, save, review and buy popular books.

Unregistered users can add books to the shopping list but it will only be available in their current browser.

To be able to access their collection from elsewhere, a user has to create an account. 
Once logged in, a user's collection of books will be stored in a cloud. Books added to the shopping list while unlogged will be automatically saved in the cloud.

The website offers dark and light color schemes that need to be switched manually. However, color scheme setting is remembered and will be restored on next visit.
