Our final team project for the JavaScript block. 

This a two-page web app with Firebase-based authorization that allows users to browse, review and buy popular books as well as add them to their shopping list. 

Unregistered users can add books to the shopping list that will only be available locally. Once logged in, a user's collection of books will be automatically saved in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere. 

The website offers dark and light color themes that need to be switched manually. The choise is written to local storage and restored on next visit.
